  <h1>What is Ransomware?</h1>
  <p>Ransomware is a type of malicious software ("malware") that locks or encrypts a user's data and demands payment, usually in cryptocurrency, to restore access. Even paying doesn't guarantee recovery (Abrams, 2022).</p>

  <h2>How Ransomware Works</h2>
  <p>There are two major types: "locker" ransomware, which locks your device, and "crypto" ransomware, which encrypts your files (Scaife et al., 2016). Some types even threaten to leak your private data.</p>

  <h2>How Ransomware Spreads</h2>
  <p>Common methods include phishing emails, unsafe websites, fake downloads, and infected USB drives (Hadlington, 2017). Unpatched software vulnerabilities also provide an entry point for attackers.</p>

  <h2>Early Impacts</h2>
  <p>Attackers target businesses, hospitals, schools, and governments. In 2020, a ransomware attack on a German hospital led to a patient's death after emergency services were disrupted (Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung, 2021).</p>

  <h1>How to Protect Yourself Against Ransomware</h1>

  <h2>Prevention Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Backup your files regularly.</li>
    <li>Keep your operating system and software updated (NCSC, 2021).</li>
    <li>Use antivirus software and enable firewalls.</li>
    <li>Be cautious with emails and downloads.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What To Do If Attacked</h2>
  <p>Disconnect your device immediately. Contact IT professionals or cybersecurity authorities like the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center. Avoid paying the ransom as it may not guarantee recovery (Europol, 2023).</p>

  <h2>Importance of Cybersecurity Awareness</h2>
  <p>Training and awareness campaigns in schools, businesses, and families can significantly reduce risks. Cybersecurity is everyone's responsibility.</p>

  <h1>Advanced Ransomware Trends and Responses</h1>

  <h2>Evolution of Ransomware</h2>
  <p>The first ransomware attack, the "AIDS Trojan," occurred in 1989. Modern attacks use Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS), making it easier for cybercriminals to operate (Scaife et al., 2016; Europol, 2023).</p>

  <h2>Famous Cases</h2>
  <p><strong>WannaCry (2017):</strong> Infected over 200,000 computers globally. <br>
  <strong>Colonial Pipeline (2021):</strong> Disrupted US fuel supply, costing millions (Abrams, 2022).</p>

  <h2>Government and Business Responses</h2>
  <p>Governments are creating stricter laws, and businesses are investing in cyber insurance and response plans. The "No More Ransom" project offers free decryption tools (Europol, 2023).</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>With trends like "double extortion" and AI-driven attacks on the rise, staying informed, cautious, and prepared is crucial. Cybersecurity is a collective effort, and basic steps can significantly reduce risks.</p>
