  <h1>Advanced Ransomware Trends and Responses</h1>

  <h2>Evolution of Ransomware</h2>
  <p>The first ransomware attack, the "AIDS Trojan," occurred in 1989. Modern attacks use Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS), making it easier for cybercriminals to operate (Scaife et al., 2016; Europol, 2023).</p>

  <h2>Famous Cases</h2>
  <p><strong>WannaCry (2017):</strong> Infected over 200,000 computers globally. <br>
  <strong>Colonial Pipeline (2021):</strong> Disrupted US fuel supply, costing millions (Abrams, 2022).</p>

  <h2>Government and Business Responses</h2>
  <p>Governments are creating stricter laws, and businesses are investing in cyber insurance and response plans. The "No More Ransom" project offers free decryption tools (Europol, 2023).</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>With trends like "double extortion" and AI-driven attacks on the rise, staying informed, cautious, and prepared is crucial. Cybersecurity is a collective effort, and basic steps can significantly reduce risks.</p>
