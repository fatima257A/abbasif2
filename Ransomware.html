    <li>Use antivirus software and enable firewalls.</li>
    <li>Be cautious with emails and downloads.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What To Do If Attacked</h2>
  <p>Disconnect your device immediately. Contact IT professionals or cybersecurity authorities like the FBIâ€™s Internet Crime Complaint Center. Avoid paying the ransom as it may not guarantee recovery (Europol, 2023).</p>
